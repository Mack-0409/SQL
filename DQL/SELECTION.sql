# LOGICAL OPERATORS
It is used to pass multiple conditions.

1. AND - It is used whenever we want to satisfy all the condition
SYNTAX - SELECT * / EXPRESSION / COLUMN_NAME
         FROM EMP
         WHERE CONDITION 1 AND CONDITION 2.......................

-- WAQTD details of the employee earing more than 2000 and work as analysis.
SELECT *

# SPECIAL OPERATOR 
1. IN - It is multi value operator which accepts multiple values at R.H.S.
        It behaves like equal operator.
        It returns true if it is satisfy any one of the value at R.H.S.

SYNTAX - COLUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION IN (VALUE1, VALUE2, VLAUE3, ........)
EXAMPLE - SAL IN (100, 700);

SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB IN ( 'MANAGER', 'PRESIDENT' ) AND
      DEPTNO IN (10 , 20) AND 
      HIREDATE > '31-DEC-80';

2. NOT IN - It is similar to IN operator instad of selecting it, it will reject the values.
SYNTAX - COUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION NOT IN (VALUES1, VALUES2, ..........) 
EXAMPLE - SAL NOT IN (100, 700);

-- WAQTD details of the employee if they are working in department number 10 or 30 but they are not working as salesman or manager or clerk.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE DEPTNO IN (10 , 30) AND
      JOB NOT IN ('SALESMAN', 'MANAGER', 'CLERK');


3. BETWEEN - It is used whenever we have a range of he values.
BETWEEN (STARTING_VALUE, ENDING_VALUE)
We cannot inter change the values.
BETWEEN operators works by including the given range.

SYNTAX - COLUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION BETWEEN (LOWER_RANGE AND HIGHER_RANGE);

FROM EMP
WHERE SAL BETWEEN (2001 AND 5999) AND EMPNO IN (7782, 7844, 7499); 

4. NOT BETWEEN - It is similar to between operator insteaded of selecting the values it will reject the values.
NOT BETWEEN (STARTING_VALUE , ENDING_VALUE)
We cannot interchangethe value.
NOT BETWEEN operators works by including the given range.

SYNTAX - COLUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION NOT BETWEEN ( LOWER_RANGE AND HIGHER_RANGE )

-- WAQTD details of the employee if they are not hired in the year of 1981.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE HIREDATE NOT BETWEEN ('01-JAN-81' AND '31-DEC-81');

SYNTAX - COLUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION IS NOT NULL;

-- WAQTD details of employee if they are earning commission.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL;

7. LIKE - It is used to match the pattern.
   SYNTAX - COLUN_NAME / EXPRESSION LIKE 'PATTERN_TO_MATCH';

    To achieve pattern matching we have 2 special character such as.
    1. % - It can accept any number of character any number of times
        Starts with character A - 'A%'
        Ends with character A - '%A'
        Has character A - '%A%'
        Has character A present twice - '%A%A%'
        Has two consecutive A - '%AA%'
        Starts with A and ends with N - 'A%N'

    2. Behaviour of '_' - It can accepts any character but only once.

-- WAQTD details of employee if they have character 'A' has a second character in the NAME.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE ENAME LIKE '_A%';

-- WAQTD details of employee if they have character 'A' in their name as a first character.
SELECT *
FROM EMP

SYNTAX - COLUMN_NAME / EXPRESSION NOT LIKE 'PATTERN_TO_MATCH';

-- WAQTD details of employee if they are not hired i the year of 1981.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE HIREDATE NOT LIKE '%81';

# SUBQUERY 
A query which is written inside another query is called as Subquery.
1. Inner query
      Inner query executes first and generates the output.
      The output for the inner query will be given as input to the outer query.

2. Outer query
      The outer query generates the result.
      Therefore, we can say that the outer query is dependent on inner query.


# CASE 1 - Whenever we have unknown or indirect condition in the question then we use the concept of Subquery.

# TYPES OF SUBQUERY
1. SINGLE ROW SUBQUERY
      If the subquery returns exactly one value, then is known as single row subquery.
      If it returns only one value then we can use the normal opeators at the special operators to compare the values.

2. MULTI  ROW SUBQUERY
      If the subquery returns exactly more than one value, then it is known as multi row subquery.
      If it returns more than one value then we cannot use the normal operators we have to use special operators to compare the values.


NOTE - It is difficult to identify whether a query belongs single row subquery or multi row subquery so it is recommended to use special operator to compare the  values.
