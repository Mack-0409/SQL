# SQL
SQL - It is a language which is used to communicate or interact with databae.
SQL [Structured Query Language]

What is Data ?
-> Data is a raw fact that describes attribute of an entity. 
<!-- Attribute = Information  & Entity = Object -->

Basic operation peform on the database are....[CRUD]
CREATE / INSERT ,  
READ / RETRIVE ,
UPDATE / MODIFY ,
DELETE / DROP .

Generally known as "CRUD" operations.

# DBMS [Database Management System]

DBMS is a software we use to maintain and mnage database.
i. Authorization
ii.Authentication

In DBMS we use query language to communicate. It is used to store data in file format.

# RDBMS 

RDBMS - A DBMS software were data will stored int the form of tables.
i. Authentication
ii.Authorization

We can use Structured Query Language [SQL] to communicate.


# Difference between DBMS and RDBMS

DBMS 
1. DBMS is a software we used to maintain and manage the database.                                       
                                                
2. We use Query Language                               
                                                     
3. In DBMS data is stored in the file format.          
                                                     
4. Performing CRUD operationis difficult compared to 
   RDBMS. 

RDBMS
1. A DBMS  software which allows Relational model becomes [RDBMS].                                       
                                            
2. We use Structured Query Language [SQL]. 
                                                     
3. In RDBMS data is stred in the the form of tables.
                                                    
4. Performing CRUD operation is easy.   

# Relational Model 

1. It is a model designed by data scientist called as Edger Frank Codd [E.F.CODD] in the year of 1970s.
2. In Realational Model we store the data in the form of rows and columns.
3. If any DBMS follows Relation Model it will become RDBMS.
